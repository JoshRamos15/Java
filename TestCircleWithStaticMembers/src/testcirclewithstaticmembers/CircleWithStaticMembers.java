/**
 Part I: Answer questions or fill in corresponding spaces 	. 
1.	2 Gigabyte (GB) = 	MB  2048      1GB = 1024
2.	Assume double[][][] x = new double[9][4][4], what is x[1].length?   	4         ******** Remember
3.	If we declare int[ ] list = {1,3,5,7,9, 1, 1}; The size of array list is?   	  7
4.	If x is 1, what are the outputs of System.out.println( ( x>=1) && ( x++<10) );   	     T
5.	"Welcome to Kean University".charAt(6) returns   	  E
6.	System.out.println((8 % 2 == 0) ? "num is even" : "num is odd");, the output is   	       num is even
Part II: Pick up one correct answer from the choices inside (): 
1.	“Class” is a reserved word that has a specific meaning to the compiler and cannot be used for other purposes in the program. (true/false)   	      F
2.	In Java, the word true is a Boolean literal. (true/false)   	       T
3.	Java language is 	(Assembly language/ Machine language/ High-level language)         High-level langauge
4.	The 	( constructor /this) keyword is the name of a reference that refers to an object itself.         this
5.	  	(Classes/ Constructors) are a special kind of methods that are invoked to construct    objects.     Constructor

1. A variable defined inside a method is referred to as 
  	. 
a.	a local variable              LOCAL
b.	a block variable 
c.	a global variable 
d.	a method variable 	2. Which of the following expression yields an integer between 0 and 100, inclusive?   	 
a.	(int)(Math.random() * 100 + 1) 
b.	(int)(Math.random() * 101)       Look up  BBBBBBBBBBBBB
c.	(int)(Math.random() * 100) 
d.	(int)(Math.random() * 100) + 1 
3. Which of the following is an invalid array declaration?   	 
a.	int[] num = new int [5]; 
b.	int num[] = new int [5]; 
c.	int[][] num = new int [5]; CCCCCCCCCCCCCC
d.	int[] num = {1, 2}; 	4. Which of the following should be declared as a void method?   	BBBBBBBBBBBB 
a.	a method that returns a random integer from 1 to 100. 
b.	a method that prints integers from 1 to 100. 
c.	a method that checks whether current second is an integer from 1 to 60. 
d.	a method that converts an uppercase letter to lowercase. 
5. What happens to the following code?     public class Test { private int t; 
public static void main(String[] args) { 
Test test = new Test(); 
System.out.println(test.t); } 
} 
a.	The program has a compiler error since class Test does not define a constructor. 
b.	The variable t is private and therefore cannot be accessed in the main method. 
c.	Since t is an instance variable, it cannot appear in the static main method. 
d.	The program compiles and runs fine. 	6. What will be the output for the following program? 
 	 DDDDDD
 
public class Test { public static void main (String args[]) 
{ int i = 0; 
for (i = 0; i < 8; i++); 
System.out.println(i + 4); } 
} 
a.	The program compiles despite the semicolon (;) on the for loop line, and displays 4.  BBBBBB B Displays 12
b.	The program compiles despite the semicolon (;) on the for loop line, and displays 12. 
c.	The program has a compile error because of the semicolon (;) on the for loop line. 
d.	The program has an infinite for loop so it won’t have any result.
